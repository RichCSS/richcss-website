                    <h3 class="content-heading black-color">What's Object Oriented CSS?</h3>
                    <p>Nicole Sullivan from Yahoo invented the concept of Object Oriented CSS.</p>

                    <p>The Object Oriented CSS framework is based on 2 main principles: Separation of structure from skin and separation of containers and content. RichCSS differs from OOCSS in many aspects. The separation is extended to the way folders and files are organized and it’s not limited to the grid system. The definition of the “Object” in RichCSS is also very different.</p>

                    <p>As Nicole explains on her the wiki; In Object Oriented CSS a CSS object consists of four things:</p>

                    <p>
                    <ol class="ordered-list-items">
                        <li>HTML, which can be one or more nodes of the DOM</li>
                        <li>CSS declarations about the style of those nodes all of which begin with the class name of the wrapper node</li>
                        <li>Components like background images and sprites required for display</li>
                        <li>JavaScript behaviours, listeners, or methods associated with the object.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>“This can be confusing because each CSS class is not necessarily an object in its own right, but can be a property of a wrapper class.</p>

                    <p>There is no confusion In RichCSS because in this framework Everything is an object.</p>

                    <h3 class="content-heading black-color">Philosophy</h3>

                    <p>RichCSS was inspired by Ruby on Rails so the philosophy it follows comes from Rails: </p>
                    <p>
                        <ol class="ordered-list-items">
                            <li>Everything is an object</li>
                            <li>Convention over configuration</li>
                            <li>Stay DRY ( Don’t Repeat Yourself )  </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="content-heading black-color">How is RichCSS different from other framework such as Bootstrap & Foundation</h3>

                    <p>RichCSS is an organizational framework. Its primary focus is to make it easy to provide an organizational style that make it easy to reuse CSS code. Frameworks such as Bootstrap & Foundation focus on making it easier and faster to get a website done following a defined style. RichCSS doesn't have a defined style but you can use any type of style pr framework with it. You can also use other framework with it.</p>

                    <p>e.g: There is no such thing as a RichCSS's button while there is a <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/buttons/">bootstrap button</a> and a <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/components/buttons.html">foundation button</a> that you can both use on RichCSS when installing the Bootstrap or Foundation parts or adding bootstrap.css or foundation.css to your project.</p>

                    <p>RichCSS provide a standard format and organization for writting and sharing CSS code. You can use bootstrap, foundation or any other framework with RichCSS but We encourage those using these other framework to write or find version of these framework that follow the RichCSS standard.</p>

                    <p>You might be able to find bootstrap & foundation parts on cssparts.com. You can <a href="cssparts.com">Contribute</a> by submitting your own parts for your favourite frameworks..</p>
